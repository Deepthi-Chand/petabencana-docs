### POST /cards/:cardId/images

POST an image to a card report, this must be done after the card report has been created and only one image can exist for a given card.  The image is uploaded in binary format and it is important to tell the server which [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) is being uploaded.  The following MIME types are accepted:

- `image/gif`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`

If this information is not supplied an HTTP error `415 Unsupported Media Type` will be returned by the server.

NOTE: After an image is submitted a server-side process shrinks the image to a standard size and there may be a small time lag of a few seconds before the image goes "live".

{% sample lang="https" %}

Here is a simple call to POST a new image:

```https
TODO```

{% common %}
Image was successfully uploaded:

```json
